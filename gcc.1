.SH NAME
gcc \- the GNU C Compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gcc
[\c
.IR options "]" FILE ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gcc
is the GNU C compiler.  It is used to compile programs written in C or similar
languages into programs and libraries for execution.
.P
While the
.B gcc
frontentd can also be used to compile other languages (see the
.B \-x
option), using the appropriate frontend is often better as it often includes
important libraries and options needed for successful compilation.  These
frontends are
.B g++
for C++,
.B gfortran
for Fortran,
.B gobjc
for Objective-C,
.B gobjc++
for Objective-C++, and
.B gccgo
for Go.
.B cpp
may be used if only the C preprocessor is needed; alternately, the
.B \-E
option to an appropriate frontend may be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.B gcc
supports a large number of options.  Most of these options can be used with any
frontend, but some are specific to a particular language or platform (processor
architecture or operating system).
.SS "General Options"
.TP
.B \-c
Invoke only the preprocessor (if appropriate), the compiler, and the assembler.
The result is an object file for the target platform.
.TP
.B \-E
Invoke only the preprocessor.  The result is preprocessed source.
.TP
.BI "\-o " FILE
Places the output of the compilation processes into
.IR FILE .
.TP
.B \-pipe
Use pipes instead of temporary files to pass data between compilation stages.
.TP
.B \-S
Invoke only the preprocessor (if appropriate) and the compiler.  The result is
assembly for the target platform.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints information about the version and configuration of the compiler, and if
any compilation or preprocessing step occurs, also prints information about the
compilation process used in those steps.
.TP
.BI "\-x " LANGUAGE
The following files are to be interpreted as being in
.IR LANGUAGE .
This continues until another
.B \-x
option is given.  If
.I LANGUAGE
is
.BR none ,
revert to autodetection based on the file's extension.
Valid values include
.BR c ,
.BR c++ ,
.BR assembler ,
and
.BR none .
