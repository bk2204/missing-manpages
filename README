This package is designed to provide manpages that are missing from Debian
packages either because no such manpages exist or because the existing manpages
are not free according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

You may simply copy the manpages into the appropriate directory.  No build
process is necessary.

The manpages are licensed under your choice of the Apache License version 2.0,
the GNU General Public License version 2, or the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike License version 3.0.
